# CAB202 Assignment 1 (Semester 2, 2018)
Code for my CAB202 C Assignment 1 (Console-based Platforming Game). The task was to create a basic platforming game using C that could run in a command line window. The aim of the game is to safely make it to the bottom of the screen and touch the moving treasure chest without colliding with the moving platforms and obstacles which kill the player.

## Building
1. Download the source code.
2. Compile the source code using gcc and the required libraries (don't have copies of them).
3. Run the executable.
